# Phygital Commerce QA Automation Framework

This project demonstrates a quality assurance and automation approach tailored for modern phygital commerce experiences — where digital fashion meets real-world products across web and virtual platforms.

Phygital fashion platforms like Meta Fashion (which bridges digital wearables and physical apparel for global brands and creators) represent a new commerce frontier. They blend e-commerce reliability, immersive avatar experiences, and real-world fulfillment into a unified product journey. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

This QA framework uses automated tests (via Playwright) and structured documentation to validate key user journeys such as product page integrity, image loading, add-to-cart flows, inventory visibility, and console-level error capture — helping ensure confidence and quality across layers of the digital-to-physical stack.

The project includes:
- Automation scripts for critical commerce paths
- A QA matrix tracking functional and visual test cases
- Evidence artifacts demonstrating issues and results
- A modular structure ready for extension to new phygital platforms

## Example Test Execution

Below is an example execution of the product page integrity test.

This test validates:
- Successful HTTP response (200)
- Page title rendering
- Image asset availability
- JavaScript console errors

By capturing both visual and technical signals, the framework helps identify issues that may impact user trust or conversion confidence in phygital commerce environments.

🌐 What MetaFashion.in Is
Meta Fashion is a fashion-tech platform that helps creators and brands launch both digital wearables and physical apparel — bridging real products with virtual fashion experiences (especially on platforms like Roblox).
In their own words, they aim to:
- Enable brands to sell digital wearables + physical garments globally
- Help creators monetize both virtual and real fashion drops
- Partner with game developers to drive retention and lifetime value through phygital experiences
- Support full workflow: concept → 3D → QA → publishing → revenue for creators & brands
Their in-house phygital brand VKYD is explicitly about translating Roblox trends into real phygital fashion products too.

Phygital commerce — a growing global trend — blends virtual avatar products with real-world apparel. Platforms in this space rely on seamless digital interactions backed by real physical fulfillment and demand high quality at scale.
